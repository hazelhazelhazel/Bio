            ABOUT ME
            
            Hello! I am Worldwide Handsome's Ult Fan haha kidding aside, I am Hazel Bongolan, a student from RVR-COB and you may be surprised to know what I am doing here in class.
            As previously mentioned by our professor, I am taking a minor class in the department which is why I am in some
            of the classes in CCS. I am hoping for your understanding if I may take a while to understand concepts, lessons,
            and some other resources since I have completed 3 classes from this college at this moment. So far, I am enjoying 
            while also stressing out regarding my coding outputs and exams in CCS. It is definitely not easy to take subjects 
            from different college, nevertheless, I felt fortunate enough to be allowed to take classes from a different college
            as I felt that I am truly maximizing my time, education, and opportunity in the university.
